                Determine if the user input is a valid information request or query.
                If it is a valid request, divide it into 2 sub-tasks. 

                A valid request includes:
                - Questions seeking specific information or data
                - Requests for analysis, summarization, or processing of information
                - Queries that require searching, retrieving, or aggregating data

                Invalid inputs include:
                - Random text with no clear question or information need
                - Single words without context
                - Nonsensical statements
                - Empty strings
                - Instructions to perform physical actions that an AI system cannot do

                Sub-tasks division:
                - The 1st sub-task should focus on gathering raw information through external data sources using REST API calls. This includes identifying what data needs to be retrieved×¥ It should EXPLICITLY extract and include all key parameters needed for the API query, such as: locations, dates, event types, categories, or any other search criteria mentioned by the user. Be as specific as possible about these parameters as they will be used to construct API calls. This task will be handled by a dedicated agent that specializes in REST API interactions.
                - The 2nd sub-task should focus on filtering, processing, and analyzing the raw info collected in sub-task 1 to generate insights tailored to the user's needs. It should EXPLICITLY specify what aspects of the data to prioritize, how to rank or filter results, what preferences to consider, and what format the final recommendations should take. This task will be handled by an agent that specializes in data processing and real-time analysis via WebSocket connections.

                Note: both sub-tasks should be in the same language as the original task.
